This will give you a chance to\nexperiment and make sure everything works before spending more time training on the full dataset.\n\nSplit the dataset's `train` split into a train and test set with the [train_test_split](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/main/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Dataset.train_test_split) method:\n\nThen take a look at an example:\n\nEach example in the dataset has two fields:\n\n- `image`: a PIL image of the food item\n- `label`: the label class of the food item\n\nTo make it easier for the model to get the label name from the label id, create a dictionary that maps the label name\nto an integer and vice versa:\n\nNow you can convert the label id to a label name:\n\n## Preprocess\n\nThe next step is to load a ViT image processor to process the image into a tensor:\n\nApply some image transformations to the images to make the model more robust against overfitting.

Unlike other data collators in ü§ó Transformers, the `DefaultDataCollator` does not apply additional preprocessing such as padding.\n\n## Evaluate\n\nIncluding a metric during training is often helpful for evaluating your model's performance.

Define your training hyperparameters in [TrainingArguments](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments). It is important you don't remove unused columns because that'll drop the `image` column. Without the `image` column, you can't create `pixel_values`. Set `remove_unused_columns=False` to prevent this behavior! The only other required parameter is `output_dir` which specifies where to save your model. You'll push this model to the Hub by setting `push_to_hub=True` (you need to be signed in to Hugging Face to upload your model).
